# ElytraFlyPlusPlus for Constantiam
This is a Meteor 1.21.4 Addon that lets you use ElytraFly+ from [BlackOut](https://github.com/KassuK1/BlackOut) on 1.21.4! FULL CREDIT to [`@KassuK1`](https://github.com/KassuK1) for the code, I did not write the original.
# How to use
Set the mode to Constantiam and the Speed and Acceleration to `1.5`. It only works in old chunks; it tends to rubberband in new chunks.
- Requires Minecraft 1.21.4 and [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com) to function.
- DM me on Discord `@h1ggsk` or join [Bugs and Exploits Central](https://discord.com/invite/zcfMqDgFnF) if you need help with any part of the mod.
- I will try to continue to update this as long as it works on Constantiam.
